>## **_Description_**

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). 

AS a business owner, I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company. So that I can organize and plan my business.

>## **_Installation_**
Please open your terminal and run either of these following code:
```
npm start
```
`or`
```
node app.js
```


>## **_Usage_**
- Node.js - Used for package management and to execute JavaScript code to build command line tool for server-side scripting.

- MySQL2: Relational database management system based on SQL – Structured Query Language, used in this application to store and query employees, departments, roles, and managers data.

- Inquirer.js: strives to be an easily embeddable and beautiful command line interface for Node.js, used for the questions in the terminal.




>## **_Credits_**
This challenge has three parts. First is to set up database by typing .sql files. I tested many times and received many same problems: 'no such syntax in SQL'. And then, built up query functions by using MySQL2. The last is 'inquirer.then'. 

I think the most challengeable part is in the last part, view by department/role/manager.
